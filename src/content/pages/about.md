<!--StartFragment-->

I am a passionate individual with an entrepreneurial spirit. I enjoy working on new ideas to make life easier for users, businesses, and society. I have half a decade of experience in building things from scratch. I started my first venture when I was 19 and had a successful run with it. Later on, I started another company in my final year, 22. I ran that company for three years with significant traction and investment from the state. I was able to secure funding of around USD 50,000. I represented the company on multiple global platforms. Unfortunately, it could not scale due to a lack of financing in the growth stages, but building world-class products was a great experience.\

I then shifted to working with AirProbe initially as a technical consultant but soon transitioned into the first product manager for the company. At AirProbe, I worked with a fantastic set of people and set up systems and processes that helped the company scale from a ten-member team to 25+. We had only one product when I started, and by the time I left, we had four products within 18 months of joining. I led two complete products. DroneBase USA recently acquired AirProbe. It was a successful acquisition, and I am proud of what my team and I have achieved together at AirProbe.\
\
I am now studying at UCI, pursuing my master's in Embedded and Cyber-physical Systems. This is one kind of program that aligns with my interest in building products that are at the intersection of hardware and software. I am currently advising some startups in India on the product, marketing, and strategy.\
