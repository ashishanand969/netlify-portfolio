**Aim of the project** - The idea behind working on smart street lighting systems was to reduce energy wastage in outdoor lighting that is incurred due to poor practices in maintainence and operations.

**Final outcomes -** We were able to install more than 50+ plus smart street lighting control gear that are operational and save over 40% more energy than conventional LED lights. I eventually started a company to further work on this project.

**Technologies Used -**

1. Sub-Ghz RF modules (Texas Instruments, Melange Systems, LoRa, WirePass)
2. Doppler Sensors (10.525 GHz)
3. Light and temperature sensor ( ALS and Thermocouples)
4. Microcontroller and Microprocessors (MSP430 and Raspeberry Pi)
5. NodeRED - For Gateways
6. AWS IoT
7. MQTT
8. MODBUS protocol
9. HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Some of the case studies and research I conducted
